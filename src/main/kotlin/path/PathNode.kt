/**
 * A read-only representation of a tree of file paths.
 *
 * Objects of this type wrap a [Path] object to allow them to form a tree of file paths. This allows file hierarchies to
 * be represented and manipulated in memory.
 *
 * This class works like a prefix tree, where each [PathNode] stores only a single path segment as [fileName]. The
 * parent node can be accessed through the [parent] property and a map of child nodes can be accessed through the
 * [children] property. The full [Path] can be accessed through the [path] property.
 *
 * Each [PathNode] has a [type], which indicates the type of file the node represents in the filesystem. An initial type
 * is provided through the constructor, but this type can change based on the state of the node. For example, if the
 * [type] of a node is a regular file, then it will change to a directory if children are added. Custom file types with
 * custom behavior can be created by implementing [FileType].
