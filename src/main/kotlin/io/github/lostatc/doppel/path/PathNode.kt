/**
 * A read-only representation of a tree of file paths.
 *
 * Objects of this type wrap a [Path] object to allow them to form a tree of file paths. This allows file hierarchies to
 * be represented and manipulated in memory. [PathNode] objects are read-only, while [MutablePathNode] objects allow the
 * tree of paths to be modified.
 *
 * [PathNode] objects work like a prefix tree, where each [PathNode] stores only a single path segment as [fileName].
 * The parent node can be accessed through the [parent] property and a map of child nodes can be accessed through the
 * [children] property. The full [Path] can be accessed through the [path] property.
 *
 * The properties [descendants] and [relativeDescendants] can be used to efficiently find descendants of this node by
 * their [Path].
 *
 * Each [PathNode] has a [type], which indicates the type of file the node represents in the filesystem. An initial type
 * is provided through the constructor, but this type can change based on the state of the node. For example, if the
 * [type] of a node is a regular file, then it will change to a directory if children are added. Custom file types with
 * custom behavior can be created by implementing [FileType].
 *
 * You can use [diff] to get a comparision of two [PathNode] objects.
 *
 * [PathNode] objects can be created using the builder method [of] which provides a DSL for specifying what the
 * directory tree should look like. They can also be created by walking a directory tree in the filesystem using
 * [fromFilesystem].

     * Constructs a new path node from the given [path] and its children.

     * This method is a type-safe builder. It allows you to create a tree of path nodes of specified types. The [init]
     * parameter accepts a lambda in which you can call builder methods like [file], [dir], [symlink] and [unknown] to
     * create new path nodes as children of this node. Builder methods can be created for custom [FileType]
     * implementations using [pathNode].
     *
     * The whole tree of path nodes will be associated with the same filesystem as [path].
     *
     * Example:
     * ```
     * val path = Paths.get("/", "home", "user")
     *
     * val pathNode = PathNode.of(path) {
     *     file("Photo.png")
     *     dir("Documents", "Reports") {
     *         file("Monthly.odt")
     *         file("Quarterly.odt")
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * @param [path] The path to construct the new path node from.
     * @param [type] The initial type of the created node.
     * @param [init] A function with receiver in which you can call builder methods to construct children.
     *
     * @return A new path node containing the given children.
