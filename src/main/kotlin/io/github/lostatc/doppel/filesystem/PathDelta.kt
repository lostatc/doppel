/**
 * A set of changes to apply to the filesystem.
 *
 * This class allows for creating a set of changes that can be applied to multiple directories. Changes are stored in a
 * queue and can be applied to the filesystem all at once. New changes can be queued up by passing instances of
 * [FilesystemAction] to the [add] method, but the filesystem is not modified until [apply] is called. There are actions
 * for moving, copying, creating and deleting files and directories. Custom actions can be created by implementing
 * [FilesystemAction].
 *
 * [FilesystemAction] classes accept both absolute and relative path nodes. If the paths are relative, they are resolved
 * against the path provided to [apply]. Using relative paths allows you to apply the changes to multiple directories.
 *
 * The [view] method can be used to see what a directory will look like after all changes are applied. The [clear] and
 * [undo] methods can be used to undo changes before they're applied.
