/**
 * A set of changes to apply to the file system.
 *
 * This class allows for creating a set of changes that can be applied to the file system. Changes are stored in a queue
 * and can be applied to the file system all at once. New changes can be queued up by passing instances of
 * [FileSystemAction] to the [add] method, but the file system is not modified until [apply] is called. There are actions
 * for moving, copying, creating and deleting files and directories. Custom actions can be created by implementing
 * [FileSystemAction].
 *
 * The [view] method can be used to see what a directory will look like after all changes are applied. The [clear] and
 * [undo] methods can be used to undo changes before they're applied.
